# Installation Instruction

# a. Working on your loptop:

1.Clone this repository

2.A precompiled jar file can be found in ./target/ds_a1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. Run the program as

java -jar ds_a1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar Outline_Cbor Lucene_INDEX Output_Dir kmeans_clu_index_Dir types_clu_index_Dir

Outline_Cbor indicates the outline files like "train.pages.cbor-outlines.cbor". Lucene_INDEX indicates the index file for corpus. Output_Dir indicates the directory you want to store the runfiles. kmeans_clu_index_Dir is the directory which stores the index file for clusters of kmeans. types_clu_index_Dir is the directory which stores the index file for clusters of types.

You can download the index file for kmeans and types from the server. Address is "/home/py1004/project/Index_kmeans_cluster" and "/home/py1004/project/Index_DBpedia_Entities".

3.Or you can compile the project by using maven. A pom file is generated in the project for that. Please locate to the project and then do

mvn package

then a executable program called "ds_a1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" can be found in "./target". Run the program using the same command line as showing above

# b. Working on server

A executable program called "ds_a1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar" is stored in "/home/py1004/project"

1.Locate to the directory.

2.Run this command line

java -jar ds_a1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /home/ns1077/benchmarkY1/benchmarkY1-train/train.pages.cbor-outlines.cbor /home/ns1077/ParagraphIndex_ALL /home/py1004/project/runfiles_output /home/py1004/project/Index_kmeans_cluster /home/py1004/project/Index_DBpedia_Entities

All files you need are set up on the server. You just need to change the argument which is "/home/py1004/project/runfiles_output" to one that you want to use to store the output runfiles.
